This repository contains my homework assignment number 9
# Task 1
Improve the task with figures
Use the Sealed modifier for the "Shape" class. 

# Task 2
Improve the task from homework #5.
Multiplication of two matrices
Create two arrays of integers of size 3x3 (two matrices).
Write a program to multiply the two matrices.
The first array: {{1,0,0,0},{0,1,0,0},{0,0,0,0}}
Second array: {{1,2,3},{1,1,1},{0,0,0},{2,1,0}}
Expected result: 1 2 3 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
Create a Utils class.
In this class create a static method to display the matrix on the screen using System.out.println.
The method should accept a two-dimensional array as input, but should return nothing as output.
Use this static method in the class to solve the matrix multiplication problem.
Use this static method to print the matrix to the screen three times - print the first matrix, print the second matrix, print the result.

# Task 3
Create a program to transfer from one client's bank card to his other card.
The data for the transfer is set from the console.
There is a client.
The system stores information about the name, surname, passport number, date of birth of the client.
As well as his postal code, country, city, street and house number.

Each card contains card number, CVC/CVV, current amount on the card, card code(id).
Cards can be of three types: BelCard, MasterCard, VisaCard.
There are limits for transfers. Limits are checked only for the card from which the transfer is made
